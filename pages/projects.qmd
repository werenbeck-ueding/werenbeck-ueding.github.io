  <p>
    In this study, we analyze whether linguistic barriers and a lack of knowledge about the German school system hinders immigrant parents from making an informed choice about their childrenâ€™s school track. As part of a randomized control trial in a large German state in the school year 2024/25, parents of fourth-graders are provided a (multilingual) mobile application containing useful information on track choice. Different versions of the App will be randomly assigned to elementary schools. *AER Registration: AEARCTR-0011821.*
