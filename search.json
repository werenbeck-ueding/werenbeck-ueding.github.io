Ruhr Economic Papers, 1156.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWe introduce a novel, non-parametric method for estimating house price indices that captures heterogeneous price developments and operates independently of strict functional form assumptions. Utilizing the potential outcomes framework, our approach employs causal forests to effectively address changes in the composition of available housing units while mitigating the curse of dimensionality inherent in traditional matching estimators. By directly incorporating geographical coordinates into the model, the algorithm autonomously determines the adaptive spatial neighborhood for each observation, thus avoiding the imposition of fixed spatial boundaries. This flexibility makes the method particularly well-suited for densely populated areas and enables the investigation of complex heterogeneity in house price developments. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through an application to apartment rental prices in six major German cities before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrating how it uncovers nuanced trends in rental price dynamics during a period of significant market change."

    "text": "Local Childcare Access and Local Employment\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nAccess to childcare reduces time constraints and caregiving burdens, enabling a broader labor force participation. While the existing literature finds that increasing access to childcare services can increase employment, little is known about how the spatial distribution of childcare services within regions affects local employment. This paper studies a large-scale expansion of the early-childcare infrastructure in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, between 2012 and 2022, and examines how variation in geographical access to childcare services affects local labor markets. Using administrative data on all daycare centers in North Rhine-Westphalia, I construct a gravity-based measure of local childcare access at the square-kilometer level. Exploiting institutional planning rules that tie slot expansions to demographic needs, I use a shift-share instrument to identify supply-side variation in access, independent of demand-driven policy targeting or parental sorting. Preliminary results show that increases in childcare access significantly reduce local unemployment and raise per-household purchasing power. These findings imply that not only the magnitude but also the spatial allocation of childcare investments matters, highlighting the importance of spatial targeting in childcare policy.\n\n\nUnintended Consequences? The Effects of a Place-based Policy on Firm Market Power with Kevin L. Berlet and Mirko Titze\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLost in Translation. Information Frictions in School Track Choice – Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment with Friederike Hertweck, Pia Schilling, and Moritz Welz\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIn this study, we analyze whether linguistic barriers and a lack of knowledge about the German school system hinders immigrant parents from making an informed choice about their children’s school track. As part of a randomized control trial in a large German state in the school year 2024/25, parents of fourth-graders are provided a (multilingual) mobile application containing useful information on track choice. Different versions of the App will be randomly assigned to elementary schools. AER Registration: AEARCTR-0011821."
